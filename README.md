Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a versatile content writer and full-stack web developer who is passionate about words and technology. I have over two years of experience in crafting compelling, engaging, and informative content across various niches. I also have experience building user-friendly websites. My journey has been a fusion of code and creativity, and I'm now working towards pivoting to technical writing. I look forward to leveraging my background in the software field and writing skills to simplify complex technical concepts, making them accessible to a broad audience. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and everyday readers by translating the jargon into plain language.

I am open to networking, collaborating, and discussing opportunities that align with my skill set and career aspirations.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning technical writing including documentation.
